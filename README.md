# CocosSharpMathGame
The goal of this project is to create a game which teaches you different mathematical skills. IT DOES NOT AIM TO TEACH MATHEMATICS. Math is beautiful, but the subject told in schools, which also calls itself "Math", tends to be somewhat different. The focus of this game is to help you train the skills you need to survive math class. It is dedicated to those who do dislike homework, but still want to improve (in a less frustrating way).

This project is currently in its first steps of development, so no math yet ;).
