The goal of this project was to create a game which lets you practice different, mostly basic, mathematical skills, without forcing you to do so at any point in the game.
The purpose of it was to find a way to help you train the skills you need to survive math class. It is dedicated to those who do dislike homework, but still want to improve (in a less frustrating way).

Gameplay-wise the game is strongly inspired by the wonderful SteamBirds.

The result, an app called MathBirds, is available on Android through the Play Store. The APK is also available [right here](https://github.com/PSteinhaus/CocosSharpMathGame/releases/tag/v.1.043) on GitHub.
